more modern times, which, if not introduced by Locke, has gained
currency from his example, of applying the expression "abstract name"
to all names which are the result of abstraction and generalization,
and consequently to all general names, instead of confining it to the
names of attributes. J. S. Mill.

Note: Abstraction is necessary to classification, by which things are
arranged in genera and species. We separate in idea the qualities of

different, in each, and arrange the objects having the same
properties in a class, or collected body.

known cause, and in opposition to what has been foreseen; as, a
fortuitous concourse of atoms. We call a thing contingent when it is
such that, considered in itself, it may or may not happen, but is
dependent for its existence on something else; as, the time of my
coming will be contingent on intelligence yet to be received.
